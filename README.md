## Clémence Guillaume Project

** Under construction, will be updated as the project develops! **

### 1. Introduction

This is my first commercial project with a **real client** after graduating from Makers Academy.

Clémence is a London-based aspiring designer, originally from France. She needed a modern, simple and responsive website to kickstart her business in vivarium, aquarium and garden design.
